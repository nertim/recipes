[https://cafedelites.com/queso/](https://cafedelites.com/queso/)

## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound 225 g fresh Cheddar cheese, shredded (smoked, sharp or American cheddar)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3/4 cup green onions, finely chopped
- 2 large cloves garlic minced
- 3.5 oz (100 g) diced tomatoes, (Roma, grape or cherry tomatoes)
- 1/2 teaspoon each ground cumin and onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, (add more to taste if desired)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch cornflour
- 13 oz (375 g) evaporated milk, (full fat)
- 4 oz 120 g fire roasted green chiles, (or jalapeños)
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped

## Steps

1. Melt butter in a medium-sized pot over medium-heat. Sauté the green onions (white parts only) for 4 minutes, until soft. Then add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
2. Add the tomatoes in with juices with the chiles, cumin, onion powder and cayenne pepper. Cook while stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes until soft and fragrant.
3. Mix cornstarch into the pot, then pour in the evaporated milk, stirring well to combine.
4. Bring to a boil, then add the cheese, mixing well. Cook, while stirring, until cheese just melts through the milk and transforms into a smooth sauce. Take off heat immediately.
5. Stir in cilantro, green onions (reserved green parts) and season with salt to taste if needed. Mix well.

## Notes

Store leftovers in the refrigerator. Reheat on stove or in microwave. Adjust consistency with a little more milk, if needed.
