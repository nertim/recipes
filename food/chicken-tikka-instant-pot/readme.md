## Steps

### Marinate the chicken
1. Combine all ingredients for the marinade (except chicken) in a bowl and mix well. Add chicken and coat on each side with the marinade. Let is rest for anywhere between 30 minutes to 8 hours in the refrigerator.

### Brown the chicken
1. Start the instant pot in Sauté mode and adjust to high setting. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the chicken pieces and lightly brown on each side for about 2 minutes. Take chicken out of the pot and cut into pieces about 2-3 inches in size. (Note: The chicken is not completely cooked yet)

### Prepare the sauce
1. Add the rest of the oil to the instant. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and sauté for about 3 minutes.
2. Add water and deglaze the pot making sure nothing is stuck to the bottom. 
3. Add tomato puree, spices and mix well. Add any leftover marinade too. Add the chicken and stir it. 

### Pressure Cook the Curry
1. Press cancel and close the lid with vent in sealing position. Change the instant pot setting to high pressure for 4 minutes. When the instant pot beeps, let it rest for 5 minutes then manually release the pressure. 
2. Add cream, kasoori methi and stir well. 
3. Garnish with cilantro. Chicken tikka masala is ready. Enjoy with basmati rice and naan. 

## Notes

- Make it dairy free: Use coconut milk in place of heavy cream in this curry. 
- Using chicken thighs: Chicken thighs could work in this recipe too. 
- Marination: Use plain full fat or greek yogurt for the marinade. Pat dry the chicken to avoid extra liquid when marinating. I marinated the chicken breasts as is, then cut them after searing. You can cut before as well. 
- In a hurry? You can skip searing the chicken when in a hurry. Dont skip marinating for at least 15 minutes (while you get the other things ready). 
- Make it the traditional way: Typically marinated chicken is broiled in the oven until it just begins to char. You can cut the chicken into pieces before marinating and brow in the oven before adding to the instant pot. 
- Tomatoes: I use canned tomato puree, however diced tomatoes will work too. If using fresh tomatoes, use 3 and puree or dice them.
- Pot-in-pot rice: I used this trivet and pot-in-pot steel bowl to make rice along with the chicken tikka masala. 
- Have you seen a burn? If your ip is prone to burn, then add 1/4 cup extra water.
