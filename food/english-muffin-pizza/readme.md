## Ingredients

- 4 whole wheat English muffins — split
- 1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 3/4 cup prepared pizza sauce — tomato, pesto, or alfredo; whichever your family likes! (We use tomato)
- Tiny Pinch kosher salt
- Pinch black pepper
- 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese — or cheddar cheese, provolone, or any cheese you like
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- Toppings of choice — such as mini pepperonis (or regular pepperonis, quartered), or sautéed veggies, such as spinach or mushrooms
- Thinly sliced fresh basil — optional for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Arrange the English muffin halves cut side up onto a baking sheet. Lightly drizzle with olive oil. Place in the oven and toast until barely golden, about 4 minutes.
3. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons pizza sauce over each one, using the back of a spoon to spread it evenly. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with mozzarella cheese and Italian seasoning. Add any desired toppings.
4. Bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the muffins are browned on the edges. Top with fresh basil. Enjoy hot.

## Notes

- TO REFRIGERATE: In a single layer, place your English Muffin Pizzas in an airtight container topping side up for up to one week. 
- TO FREEZE/MAKE AHEAD: Toast you English muffin halves as directed and top as desired. Lay the English Muffin Pizzas topping side up on a baking sheet and place in the freezer for at least two hours. Once completely frozen, place each pizza in a freezer-safe container, separating layers of English Muffin Pizzas with parchment paper. 
- REHEAT FROM FROZEN: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Lay your frozen English Muffin Pizzas on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until heated through.
