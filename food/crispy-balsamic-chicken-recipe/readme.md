## Ingredients
- 
- 1/4 c. plus 3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tbsp. freshly chopped rosemary
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 10 whole peeled garlic cloves, ends trimmed
- 1 lb. brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and halved or quartered, if large
- 2 tbsp. freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°. In a large bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup oil, balsamic, thyme, and rosemary and season generously with salt and pepper. Add chicken thighs and toss to coat.
2. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and sear chicken thighs skin-side down until crispy, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Wipe out skillet, if desired.
3. To skillet add remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add whole garlic cloves and brussels sprouts and season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat until fragrant and deeply golden, about 10 minutes.
4. Return chicken to skillet and nestle in brussels sprouts. Bake until chicken is cooked through and brussels sprouts are tender, 15 minutes.
5. Garnish with Parmesan before serving.
