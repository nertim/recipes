## Ingredients

- (9 inch) double crust pie crusts
- 0.5 cup unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 0.5 cup white sugar
- 0.5 cup packed brown sugar
- 0.25 cup water
- 8 granny smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced

## Steps

1. Melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar and water; bring to a boil. Reduce temperature, and simmer 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work of crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
3. Bake 15 minutes at 425째F (220째C). Reduce the temperature to 350째F (175째C), and continue baking for 35-45 minutes.

## Notes

- You might want to set a baking sheet under the pie to catch any drips.
