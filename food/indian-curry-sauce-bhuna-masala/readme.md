# Indian curry sauce - tomato and onion
[]()

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Oil
- 5 Onions yellow medium diced
- 10 cloves Garlic minced
- 2 inch Ginger grated
- 4 Green Chili Pepper I used Thai chili, optional
- 6 Tomatoes medium chopped, I used Roma tomatoes

### Spices

- 2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder adjust to taste
- 5 teaspoon Coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
- 1 teaspoon Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
- 2 teaspoon Salt

## Steps

1. Start the instant pot in Saute(more) setting and let it heat until it displays HOT.
2. Add oil, then diced onions and stir them.
3. Saute the onions for about 15 minutes. You dont need to stir for the first 8-10 minutes, as the onions release water and do not stick to the pot. After 10 minutes, stir at regular intervals.
4. Add ginger, garlic and green chili pepper and mix well. Saute for 5 mins, while stirring frequently.
5. Add the spices. Then add tomatoes and stir well.
6. Saute for about 3 minutes. We don't want to cook down the tomatoes completely, as we need the tomato liquid for pressure cooking. Scrape the bottom to make sure nothing is stuck. If needed, add 1-2 tablespoons of water and deglaze the pot.
7. Press Cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position. Set the instant pot to manual or pressure cook mode for 5 minutes at high pressure.
8. When the instant pot beeps, let the pressure release naturally. Open the pot and give it a good stir.
9. You can leave the masala as is or blend using an immersion blender or in a standalone blender. Keep it chunky or smooth depending on your taste.
