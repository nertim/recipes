## Ingredients

- 1 onion, diced (or sub 2 fat shallots)
- 6  cloves garlic, rough chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cups diced veggies â€“ any mix of carrots, celery, parsnip, bell pepper, potato, cabbage (I normally use 1 â€“2 carrots, 1 parsnip, 1â€“2 celery)
- 1 1/2  teaspoons salt, more to taste.
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 2 teaspoons coriander
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice (optional)
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 medium tomatoes, diced with their juices (one 14.5 ounce can, diced)
- 4 flavorful cups chicken or veggie stock (or use 3 bouillon cubes w/ water)
- 2 cups water
- 1 Â¼ cup small Black Caviar lentils or French Green Lentils (You can always use bigger, brown lentils, but increase pressure cooking time to 20 minutes.) You can also substitute split lentils for Â¼ cup of the lentils for a creamier texture.  ðŸ™‚

## Steps

1. Saute onion and garlic in the Instant Pot in 2 tablespoons oil until fragrant and tender, about 2-3 minutes.  (Or cook in a dutch oven on the stove, over medium-high heat)
2. Add the veggies, spices and salt. Saute 4-5 more minutes. Add the tomato paste and brown it a bit. Add the tomatoes and their juices, stock and water, scraping up any browned bits. Add the lentils, stir and cover, setting the Instant pot to Pressure Cook on Normal for 12 minutes. (Alternately if cooking on the stove top, bring to a simmer and cover, simmering on low for 20-25 minutes)
3. Let the pressure release either manually or naturally.
4. Divide among bowls and drizzle with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, chili flakes, fresh parsley and fresh diced tomato (optional)x
