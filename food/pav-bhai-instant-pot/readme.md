## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp Butter or Oil
- 2 cups Red Onions diced
- 3 cups Tomato chopped, about 5 large
- 1" inch Ginger
- 8 cloves Garlic
- 3 Whole Dried Kashmiri Red Chili Pepper
- 1 Bell pepper chopped, 130gms
- 3 Potato medium, peeled and chopped. I used russet potatoes. about 3 cups or 440gms
- 1 Carrot cut in pieces, 90gms or 2/3 cup
- 1 1/2 cup Cauliflower (Gobi) cut in small pieces
- 3/4 cup Green peas
- 1/2 cup Water
- 2 tbsp Pav Bhaji Masala
- 1 tsp Salt or to taste
- 1 tbsp Lemon juice

### Garnish

- 1/2 Onion chopped
- 1/4 cup Cilantro to garnish

## Steps

1. Soak red whole chili in 1/2 cup water for 15 mins. Grind chili, ginger and garlic along with the water to a paste. (Note: if you skip grinding chilies with water, then do add 1/2 cup water before pressure cooking and add the ginger/garlic along with the onions)
2. Start instant pot in sauté mode and heat 2 tbsp butter/oil in it. Add onions and sauté for 3 minutes.
3. Add bell pepper and sauté for another 2 minutes.
4. Add tomatoes, pav bhaji masala and salt. Add the ground chili paste. If anything is stuck to the bottom of the pot, scrape it with a spatula. (See notes if you have had a Burn issue in your instant pot or using 8qt instant pot)
5. Add cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, and green peas. Mix well. Press cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position. 
6. Change the setting to manual or pressure cook mode at high pressure for 8 minutes.
7. When the instant pot beeps, release the pressure naturally. Open and use an immersion blender to coarsely grind the ingredients. You can also use a potato masher to mash the bhaji to the desired consistency. 
8. Change to sauté mode and let the bhaji boil for a minute. Mix in the lemon juice. Bhaji is ready to be served.

## Notes

### Pro-tips:

- The real Mumbai pav bhaji is always made with butter.  However you can prepare it will oil too.
- I recommend using Kashmiri chili, as that enhances the color of the bhaji.  You can also use Kashmiri Red Chili powder, about 1-2 teaspoons based on your taste. 

**Pav Bhaji Masala:** My preferred pav bhaji masala brand is Everest. If you want to make a quick homemade pav bhaji masala powder, here is the recipe - 1 tsp coriander powder + 1 tsp garam masala + 1 tsp dry mango powder (or lemon juice) + 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
