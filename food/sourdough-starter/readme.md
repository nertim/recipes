# Sourdough Starter
[Personal](../../readme.md)

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 2 cups water 
- 2 tsp dry yeast

## Steps

1. In a non-metallic bowl or jar carefully mix all the ingredients together
2. Loosely cover with cheese cloth or paper towel
3. Let it sit in a warm and humid space for 4 days
4. Stir once a day
5. After 5 days stir the mix, seal it and place it in the fridge

## Usage

1. Remove the starter from the fridge 24 hours before usage
2. Use the amount required by the desired recipe
3. Add 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water and mix it with remaining starter

## Notes

- The initial mix for the starter will grown before it settles. So this will spill over if you are using a smaller container or jar. My recommendation would be to have it where the initial mixture should be a big enough container which would allow it to grow 150%.
