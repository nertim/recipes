## Ingredients

- Cooking spray, for pan
- 17 pineapple rings, fresh or canned 
- 1 large salmon fillet (about 3 lbs.) 
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tbsp. melted butter
- 3 tbsp. sweet chili sauce
- 2 tbsp. freshly chopped cilantro
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish
- Thinly sliced green onions, for garnish
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and grease with cooking spray. In the center of the foil, lay pineapple slices in an even layer.
2. Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper and place on top of pineapple slices.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together butter, chili sauce, cilantro, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. Brush all over salmon fillet.
4. Bake until the salmon is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Switch the oven to broil, and broil for 2 minutes, or until fish is slightly golden. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions and serve with lime wedges.
