[https://pipingpotcurry.com/instant-pot-hummus/](https://pipingpotcurry.com/instant-pot-hummus/)

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Chickpeas (Chole/Garbanzo beans) dry
- 2 1/2 tbsp Olive Oil
- 2 cloves Garlic
- 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
- 1/4 tsp Black pepper
- 1/8 cup Tahini
- 1/2 tsp Red Chili powder (Mirchi powder)
- 1 Lemon

## Steps

1. Wash and soak dried chickpeas for 4 hours in about 4 cups of water.   
2. After that, add the chickpeas to the Instant Pot along with the water.  Add salt. Start the Instant Pot in Bean/Chili mode, it will automatically set timer to 30 mins.  
3. When the Instant Pot beeps, quick release the pressure manually. Remove the leftover liquid in a separate bowl, we can add as needed when grinding the chickpeas.
4. Transfer the chickpeas to a blender (I used Vitamix) and let them cool down for about 10 minutes.
5. Add the other ingredients (tahini, garlic, pepper, chili powder) to the blender. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and juice of one lemon. Blend to a smooth paste. Add water that we kept aside as needed to get a creamy texture (I added about 1 cup).
6. Transfer to a bowl and garnish with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and sprinkle some pepper and chili powder.

## Notes

- If you decide to use canned chickpeas instead, drain them and cook on high pressure 2 cups of water for 5 mins in the instant pot. Quick release the pressure after 5 mins.
