- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, you can always add more later
- 1 teapoon italian seasoning mix (optional)
- 1 to 2 lbs of shrimp, cleaned, devined, etc.

## Steps
1. Get the dry seasonings - salt, pepper flakes, and italian seasoning mix ready in a small container
2. Juice the lemons in a small container
3. Crush or slice or dice the garlic in a small container
4. Melt the stick of butter in a saucepan on low heat (you dont want the butter to burn)
5. Once the stick of butter is about 90% melted, add in the garlic, lemon, and dry seasonings to the saucepan
6. Once the stick of butter is fully melted, remove from heat. Make sure all the ingredients are mixed
7. Pre-heat the oven to 350F
8. Marinade the shrimp thoroughly
9. Line up the shrimp in a oven safe tray (hopefully a glass one) and pour over some of the marinade.
10. Once the oven is at 350F, put in the shrimp for 12 mins

## Notes
- Most likely you will have frozen shrimp. Stick the frozen shrimp under cool water to thaw. 
- Once the shrimp is thawed and washed, dry it a little. 
- Save the left over in fridge for up to 3 days.
