# Tzatziki Sauce

[https://healthyrecipesblogs.com/tzatziki-recipe/](https://healthyrecipesblogs.com/tzatziki-recipe/)

## Ingredients
- 2 cups plain full-fat Greek yogurt (I use Fage Greek Yogurt)
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper (black is OK but will be visible on the white sauce)
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
- 1 large cucumber peeled, coarsely grated
- ¼ cup chopped fresh dill
- ¼ cup water (if making a chilled soup rather than a sauce)

## Steps
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, kosher salt and white pepper.
2. Mix in the garlic, cucumber and dill.
3. If you'd like to make a chilled soup, add as much water as needed to slightly thin out the tzatziki, starting with ¼ cup. Don't add too much water - you want this thick and hearty.
4. Cover and chill for one hour to allow flavors to develop. Mix the tzatziki one more time before serving.
