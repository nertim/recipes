## Ingredients

### Non-spices

- 1 tablespoon Ghee or Oil
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)
- 1 Green Chili Pepper optional
- 1 cup Onion diced
- 1/2 tablespoon Ginger grated
- 1/2 tablespoon Garlic minced
- 2 Tomato about 1.5 cup
- 2 Potatoes medium, peeled and cut into 1" cubes
- 10 Baby Eggplant or 1 large eggplant, cut into 1.5 inch pieces, washed and cleaned
- 1/4 cup Water
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 1 tablespoon Lime juice
- Cilantro to garnish

### Spices

- 1/2 teaspoon Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
- 2 teaspoon Coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
- 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder optional, adjust to taste
- 1 teaspoon Salt adjust to taste

## Steps

1. Start the pressure cooker in sauté mode and let it heat. Add oil and cumin seeds. Saute for 30 seconds.
2. When the cumin seeds change color, add green chili, onions, ginger and garlic. Sauté for 3 minutes until the onions become golden brown while stirring frequently.
3. Add tomato and spices. Stir and let them cook for 2 minutes until the tomatoes are softened. You can optionally cover with a lid.
4. Add potatoes, eggplant and water. Stir and scrape off anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Press Cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position.
5. Change the instant pot setting to manual or pressure cook mode at high pressure for 3 mins. After the instant pot beeps, quick release the pressure manually.
6. Open the pot. Mix in the garam masala and lime juice.
7. Garnish with cilantro. Serve aloo baingan with roti, naan or paratha.

## Notes

Make it less spicy: Skip the green chili and reduce red chili powder.

Which Green chili to use? I typically use Thai, Birdeye or Serrano Chili Pepper in my recipes. Don't forget to adjust to your taste.

Cutting the veggies: It is important to cut the veggies in large size about 1 inch so that the eggplants and potatoes don't get too mushy while pressure cooking.
