## Ingredients

- 2 lbs to 2 Â¼ lb chicken thighs (boneless and skinless, or skin on)
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons ground coriander
- 8 cloves minced garlic cloves
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoon allspice
- 1 lemon

## Steps

1. Place all ingredients except chicken in a bowl and mix, or pulse in a food processor to make a paste.
2. Rub chicken on all sides with the marinade and let sit 20 minutes (or up to 24 hours refrigerated).
3. Grill chicken on a pre-heated BBQ, on medium high heat, closing the lid to the BBQ, until all sides have nice grill marks, about 8 minutes each side. Finish chicken in a 350 F oven until cooked all the way through, about 10 minutes.  ( Alternatively you can  bake the chicken thighs in a 375 F oven for 30-40 minutes)
4. Enjoy the chicken over Israeli salad, or with rice and veggies.
