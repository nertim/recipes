### Spices

- 0.5 tsp ground red pepper
- 0.25 tsp ground asafoetida (optional)
- 0.5 tsp garam masala (used at the end)

## Steps

1. Get all the ingredients ready. Eventually all the vegetables will be blended, so no need for fine chopping. Also get the spices (except garam masala) ready in a small bowl.
2. Boil water in a deep saucepan and cook the Spinach for 3-4 mins. Dont cook too long, as the color will get too dark.
3. Drain all the hot water and put cold water on the spinach so it stops cooking.
4. In a frying pan heat up half the oil and put cumin seeds in it.
5. Once the cumin seeds are cooking with bubbles around them, put in the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and thai pepper.
6. Once the onions are translucent and soft, put in the tomatoes.
7. Cook till the tomatoes are soft (should be at least 4 - 5 mins).
8. Remove from heat and let it cool.
9. Put the cool spinach, onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes mix in a blender and blend it smooth. 
10. If the the mixture is too thick, add a little bit of water to thin it.
11. In a different (or the same) frying pan heat up the remaining oil. Once he oil is hot, put in all the spices (except garam masala).
12. Cook the spices for about 2 - 3 mins and pour in the spinach mixture, and mix it all up.
