## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tsp fresh root ginger
- 1-2 tsp Thai red curry paste (we used Sharwood's)
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 50g sachet coconut cream
- 400g raw frozen prawns
- coriander, chopped, to serve (optional)

## Steps

1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Tip in the onion and ginger, then cook for a few mins until softened. Stir in the curry paste, then cook for 1 min more. Pour over the chopped tomatoes and coconut cream. Bring to the boil, then leave to simmer for 5 mins, adding a little boiling water if the mixture gets too thick.
2. Tip in the prawns, then cook for 5-10 mins more, depending on how large they are. Serve alongside some plain rice and sprinkle with a little chopped coriander, if you like.
