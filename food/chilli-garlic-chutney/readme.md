## Ingredients

- 10 Dried Red Chili Whole kashmiri chili prefered
- 1 cup hot Water for soaking chili
- 10 cloves Garlic medium, peeled
- 1/4 tablespoon Salt
- 1/2 cup Water for blending

## Steps

1. Start by removing the stem of the dry kashmiri red chilies. Then soak them in hot water for about half hour before you start making this chutney. Make sure there just enough water to cover the chilis completely.
2. Later drain the water using a strainer.
3. Then combine the peeled garlic cloves and the chilis along with salt and water in a blender.
4. Blend them smoothly. Donâ€™t add too much water to this chutney as it would thin out its consistency.
5. Enjoy with chaat recipes.
