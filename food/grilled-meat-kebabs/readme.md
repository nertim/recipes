[https://littlechefbigappetite.com/grilled-ground-beef-kebabs-recipe/](https://littlechefbigappetite.com/grilled-ground-beef-kebabs-recipe/)

## Ingredients
- 1 lb. lean ground meat (I used 93% lean)
- 1/4 cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt
- 1/2 egg, lightly beaten
- 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 3 Tablespoons chopped onion
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Tablespoon coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice
- pinch teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 5-6 skewers

## Steps
1. Combine all ingredients (ground beef through ground black pepper) in a large bowl. Mix until thoroughly combined.
2. Separate the mixture into 5-6 balls. Roll each into a log about 1.5 inches thick and 5-6 inches long. Insert a skewer through each log. Place on a baking sheet or cutting board and refrigerate for 30 minutes (this part is important to ensure the meat holds together when they are grilled).
3. Heat a grill to medium-high heat. Grill the kebabs for 3-4 minutes on first side and then flip and grill for an additional 3 minutes, making sure to watch them as to not overcook. Remove from grill and serve immediately with [hummus](../instant-pot-hummus/readme.md) and/or [tzatziki](../tzatziki-sauce/readme.md).
