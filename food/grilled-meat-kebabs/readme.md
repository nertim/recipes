## Ingredients
- 1 lb. lean ground meat (I used 93% lean)
- 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 yellow onion minced and drained. Let all the juices drain
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp sumac

## Steps
1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix until thoroughly combined.
2. Separate the mixture into 5-6 balls. Roll each into a log about 1.5 inches thick and 5-6 inches long. Insert a skewer through each log. Place on a baking sheet or cutting board and refrigerate for 30 minutes (this part is important to ensure the meat holds together when they are grilled).
3. Heat a grill to medium-high heat. Grill the kebabs for 3-4 minutes on first side and then flip and grill for an additional 3 minutes, making sure to watch them as to not overcook. Remove from grill and serve immediately with [hummus](../instant-pot-hummus/readme.md) and/or [tzatziki](../tzatziki-sauce/readme.md).
